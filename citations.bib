    This chapter introduces the logical-framework way of formalizing a
    deduction system (a fragment of the intuitionistic first-order logic):
    specifying the abstract syntax of it, judgments and deductions in it;
    implementing it via logic meta-programming; and establishing meta-theories
    about it.

  note      = {
    This paper compares from a denotationally-semantic point of view four
    Lisp-family languages, including Lisp 1.0, Modern Lisp (fexpr Lisp), funarg
    Lisp and Scheme, and shows that Lisp 1.0 and Scheme are compositional while
    the other two are not.
