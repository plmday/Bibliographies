    This chapter introduces the logical-framework way of formalizing a
    deduction system (a fragment of the intuitionistic first-order logic):
    specifying the abstract syntax of it, judgments and deductions in it;
    implementing it via logic meta-programming; and establishing meta-theories
    about it.
